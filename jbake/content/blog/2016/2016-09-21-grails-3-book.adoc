I'm excited to announce that I've been working on a book for the Grails 3 framework - https://www.grails3book.com[Practical Grails 3]!

The question of "Will there be a Grails 3 book?" has been on the mind of many of you. I've been working on this book for the past 6 months and am very excited to share that it's almost here!

This is the first book dedicated to the latest Grails 3 framework. It is a practical guide to Grails which will get beginners started quickly, intermediate users will learn best practices and advanced users will learn something new as well.

The book covers the concepts behind many of the best practices when building a Grails 3 application. I cover the full life cycle from getting your environment setup to production deployment and everything in-between.

The second half of the book is dedicated to building a non-trivial application using and expanding on the concepts learned. I'll cover best practices, common gotcha's, plugins, spring boot, deployments, monitoring, and a whole lot more.

This is a living book. There will be regular updates when versions of Grails 3 are released covering the changes and new features.
