Official changelog https://github.com/grails/grails-core/releases/tag/v3.2.12

New app diffs: https://github.com/erichelgeson/grails-versions/compare/3.1.15...3.2.12

## Major Changes

* Autowireing of domain classes off on *new* 3.2.8 apps for performance improvements.
  - Eg: Spring-security core password encoder will not be wired. (Fixed in 3.1.2 on 4/22/2017)
  - Re-Enable
    - Globally: `grails.gorm.autowire = true`
    - GORM Event example: https://github.com/grails-plugins/grails-spring-security-core/blob/master/src/main/templates/PersonPasswordEncoderListener.groovy.template
      - NOTE: This will only work in Grails 3.2.9 or GORM 6.0.10 due to a https://github.com/grails/grails-data-mapping/issues/885#issuecomment-291882517[bug in GORM 6.0.9] which shipped by default with this version.

* Reactor events in GORM off for performance improvements.
  - Discussion: https://github.com/grails/grails-core/issues/640#issuecomment-286736679
  - Re-enable them with `grails.gorm.reactor.events = true`

* Profiles create broken apps with 3.2.8
  - Discussion: https://github.com/grails/grails-core/issues/10562
  - Profiles haven't been updated to use the new properties introduced in 3.2.8. Fixed in 3.2.9 and workaround in issue discussion.
