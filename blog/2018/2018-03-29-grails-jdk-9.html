<p>Oracle has announced they will be drastically <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html">speeding up their JDK releases – one every 6 months</a> with <a href="https://jaxenter.com/end-life-comes-early-jdk-8-140824.html">no overlapping public support</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java 9 was the first in this accelerated release cycle. While these JDK releases come quick, they end just as quickly. As you’re reading this JDK 9 is already end of life(EOL) and JDK 10 was just released (which will be EOL in 6 months.) JDK 11 will be the first long term support (LTS) release of the JDK.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With all this news, there has been some confusion about what will support what when and how people should be planning for in regards to Java releases. I’ll provide a few facts (and a few of my opinions) on what this means to you as a Grails developer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s start by answering a few concrete questions.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="will_grails_3_build_on_jdk_9">Will Grails 3 build on JDK 9+?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Grails 3.3.x is based on Spring-Boot 1.5. Spring-Boot 1.5 does not and will not support building in JDK 9+.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From their wiki: <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-with-Java-9#requirements" class="bare">https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-with-Java-9#requirements</a></p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spring Boot <strong>2</strong> is the first version to support Java 9 (Java 8 is also supported). If you are using 1.5 and wish to use Java 9 you should upgrade to 2.0 as <strong>we have no plans to support Java 9 on Spring Boot 1.5.x</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That’s <em>definitive</em> – you won’t be building Grails 3 apps in anything but JDK7/8 (and that’s ok, keep reading!)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="will_grails_3_run_on_jdk9">Will Grails 3 run on JDK9+?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a <strong>much</strong> different question -</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The answer is yes – Groovy runs (with a few warnings). You will need to add <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-with-Java-9#jaxb"><code>jaxb</code> explicitly to your CLI or in your dependencies</a> – but it will run. If you use other 3rd party libraries though you will need to validate they will run on JDK9+ as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is great news for user’s environments where you are not able control your runtime and are forced to run on a newer JDK.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="if_i_m_on_jdk8_how_long_will_it_be_supported">If I’m on JDK8 how long will it be supported?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Oracle JDK8 will receive pubic updates <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html">through January 2019</a>  – which is cutting it quite close. Oracle <a href="https://jaxenter.com/end-life-comes-early-jdk-8-140824.html">plans no overlapping publicly supported binaries</a> giving no breathing room for developers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My recommendation is to switch to OpenJDK 8 which will be supported until <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/1299013">October 2020</a> or pay Oracle for support. If you run on any PaaS such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk you’ve already been running on OpenJDK (<a href="http://sdkman.io/">sdkman</a> makes it easy to setup OpenJDK on your workstation as well.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="when_can_i_use_java_9_10_11_with_grails">When can I use Java 9/10/11 with Grails?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spring-Boot 2 was just <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2018/03/01/spring-boot-2-0-goes-ga">recently released (March 2018.)</a> The Grails team is already working on Grails 4 based off it. Quarter 4 of this year (2018) is the targeted release.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="now_for_a_few_of_my_opinions">Now for a few of my opinions.</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Grails builds on top of many projects such as Spring-Boot, Hibernate, Gradle, etc. All of these projects must support the latest JDK before Grails can. This IMO is a good thing – it means many compatibility issues and bug fixes can be worked out before we start using it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="what_should_we_do_for_now">What should we do for now?</h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Spring-Boot 1.5 line is still being actively developed and Grails will continue to use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using Oracles JDK 8 switch to OpenJDK 8 for security updates or pay Oracle for extended support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue to build on JDK 8 and you should be fine running on JDK 10/11 if you need to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t adopt sort term support (STS) or end of life JDK’s such as 9/10</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stick to LTS JDK releases such as 8 and 11.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The release of JDK11 (LTS) and Grails 4 will be around the same time - 2018 Q4 – which is really not that far off. Grails 3.3+ and Spring-Boot 1.5+ are still great choices for building new apps on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I use Grails so I don’t have to worry about these compatibility issues – I get a nice package of things that are recent and work together. I’ll be happy to let this JDK madness shake out before I get in the middle of it – I have features to ship to users rather than worry about JDK’s that are only supported for 6 months.</p>
